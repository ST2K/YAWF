#Yet Another Webfront for STV2k Researching
> [PAMI Centre](http://pami.xmu.edu.cn), Xiamen University

Actually there's no other webfront, so this repo should not be a 'Yet Another'.
Anyhow, this is a web project written for visualizing and dashboarding STV2k Researching, since it's a Computer Vision project which deals with loads of images and captions.

### Dependency

The tech stack will be using:

+ [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com)
+ [Python 3.x](https://python.org)
+ [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
+ [uWSGI](https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi)* *A temporary WSGI choice which may change later*

Caddy comes with the following plugins:

+ TODO



And yes there may not be a fancy front framework, but we may choose [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) if in mood : ) 
However the interacting and visualizing ability will comes first.
